It's the final week, the final stretch, the thing that gets me a laptop. 

## 2.5 hours.. how?

How on EARTH did I spend 2.5 hours on this?

I feel like thats what your asking yourself.

Well for starters, I'm not even done with the sketch, like wtf. Here's an image of the image

<img width="1690" height="455" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55bdb597-9823-419d-893f-affabea9acb9" />

That's what it is rn

We should rewind.

I initally made this:

<img width="1173" height="343" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-24 194736" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46f48110-4052-4897-822e-829108f47fb6" />

Then added to that:

<img width="1467" height="394" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-24 201323" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7d4205b-7a91-4109-9cb3-0746d54fa2bf" />

Then added to THAT:

<img width="1327" height="318" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-24 202611" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/620fde05-69ab-4be1-a667-3fc8eb170627" />

I had filleted every single vertex there, mainly cuz I didnt use a single circle in the sketch (except one for the ring of the thingy)

and then I iterated the sketch to this: 

<img width="1056" height="314" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-24 203525" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69c66894-690a-46c3-97ad-664f40720ec7" />

And then in the end I'm back to iterating the sketch to the intial pic in the top of this journal.

And that's where my two and a half hours went.
