It's the final week, the final stretch, the thing that gets me a laptop. 

## 2.5 hours.. how?

How on EARTH did I spend 2.5 hours on this?

I feel like thats what your asking yourself.

Well for starters, I'm not even done with the sketch, like wtf. Here's an image of the image

That's what it is rn

Before I had made this:

<img width="1173" height="343" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-24 194736" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46f48110-4052-4897-822e-829108f47fb6" />

Then like this:

<img width="1467" height="394" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-24 201323" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7d4205b-7a91-4109-9cb3-0746d54fa2bf" />

Then like this:

<img width="1327" height="318" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-24 202611" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/620fde05-69ab-4be1-a667-3fc8eb170627" />

I had filleted every single vertex there, mainly cuz I didnt use a single circle in the sketch (except one for the ring of the thingy)

and then I iterated the sketch to this: 

<img width="1056" height="314" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-24 203525" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69c66894-690a-46c3-97ad-664f40720ec7" />

And then in the end I'm back to iterating the sketch to the intial pic in the top of this journal.

And that's where my two and a half hours went.
